She used her 9 months of pregnancy to put herself through technical school in record time and got her haircutting/makeup license. She had her little baby like a champ, took a few months to get through that first newborn phase at my mom's house, and then one day she decided she needed to try independence so she marched into the most upscale hair salon in the city and demanded a shot at a job. She got it.\n\nShe makes more money than I do now, has a college fund going for her  now 3 year old daughter, and is generally kicking ass.

I am the only male, and probably person, she trusts (her relationship with our mother is strained, to say the least), and I&amp;#39;m always so worried about how she&amp;#39;ll turn out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really hope for the best for her, and it tears me apart on a daily basis to think about the pains she has to bear.  But it makes me sincerely happy to hear that your sister has turned out well.  My sister doesn&amp;#39;t want children though...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How else have you dealt with your sister&amp;#39;s trauma?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_10c96s", "parent_id": "t1_c6c860m", "approved_by": null, "likes": null, "author_flair_text": null, "id": "c6c8l2c", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "num_reports": null, "ups": 381, "name": "t1_c6c8l2c"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "Wonderful story.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1348438537.0, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "aierx48hq220e071afad3237b7972087275bb6c6ff326e4c72", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "Thank you.

Friend goes on to make a complete recovery being motivated to not let his two best friends child have any less of a life.  He raises the child as if it were his own, helping to heal the wife who is his other best friend come to terms with her grief.  Takes the child to school everyday, picks him up everyday and most heart wrenching are the conversations they have with the deceased father everyday so that his son will grow up still knowing who his father is.  Is he trying to move in on his best friends life. Absolutely not.  The wife is like a sister to him and he would never even consider it.  He has put his own life on hold to try to fix a horrible situation and asks nothing in return said for that the memory of his dead friend is never forgotten.  This guy lives in a world of pain both physically and mentally because of that car wreck but never lets the wife and child see it.  He gets very defensive if you call him a parent and will tell you his deceased friend is the parent he just cant be there.  I understand, but I still think he is a wonderful parent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_10c96s", "parent_id": "t3_10c96s", "approved_by": null, "likes": null, "author_flair_text": null, "id": "c6c8css", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "num_reports": null, "ups": 297, "name": "t1_c6c8css"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "I went to high school with a guy who ended up getting his girlfriend pregnant freshman year of college.

I have to say, I think my wife's grandmother (grandmother-in-law?) takes the cake. When she can, I'll have my wife come fill in more details with her account but until then, here's your story. Enjoy.\n\nThe year is 1964 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Back then, the town was very segregated based on income. It all depended what side of the railroad tracks you lived on. If you lived on the east side, you were a rich, well off country club going family. The east side was the poorer side; farmers, construction workers, waitresses, you get the idea.\n\nGrandma Patty's husband has just died this year; they lived on the east side. He left behind her, a 26 year old mother, a widow. Not only just a mother - a mother of 8 children. **EIGHT FUCKING KIDS**. 7 boys, and 1 girl. All of them 1 year apart. The oldest was 9 years old, the youngest was a newborn. \n\nNow mind you - this was in the 60s. The heart of the cultural revolution. Except this was in a motherfucking Iowa. It hadn't exactly caught up yet, and really never has there. Its the midwest - that's the way the shit happens. Grandma Patty raised these 8 boys and 1 girl herself. Entirely. She never remarried, never dated, never had any more help than a church would give a single mother of 8 children. She worked 3 jobs until she was in her 50's. She worked non-stop, and still had time to be a mother the whole time. \n\nWhen you ask her about it, she plays it off like it \"wasn't a big deal\". HA HA. Not only did she actually raise 8 great children (My father-in-law included is an awesome guy), but they have all continued to raise great families as well. Me, the son in law? I was basically brought into this family now. I never had much family - just my mother, really, and that's another story all together but she passed away 2 years ago. Grandma Patty has made a huge effort to make sure I feel like a part of the family, and I can never thank her enough for that.\n\nI went to my first family reunion on their side of the family a fair bit ago.

The guy looks at her flabbergasted. She keeps going \"Well? Do you just not like us? Because I know your not married, so you must love women\". He just blinks. She laughs, turns around, and comes back and sits down to breakfast with us.\n\nShe's an amazing woman. And she raised 8 kids all by herself in the middle of the 60s and 70s with no help, and they all turned out great.\n\nThat's my amazingly inspiring story and person. My wife should be awake soon to fill in any details I missed. But not only has this women beaten the odds, helped her community, and raised an amazing family, but she's still going! She loves her grand-kids and great-grand-kids and even weathered a flight to Hawaii for our wedding (Flying Iowa-&gt;Hawaii in your 80's is not an easy thing to do). \n\nSo here's to you, Grandma Patty, for teaching me, your family, and countless others what life and family is **really** fucking about.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1348438854.0, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "aierx48hq220e071afad3237b7972087275bb6c6ff326e4c72", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "children": ["c6cbsgo", "c6c9za9"], "id": "c6cbsgo", "name": "t1_c6cbsgo"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "banned_by": null, "downs": 11, "author": "jaynus", "created_utc": 1348413654.0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read through all these stories, and they are all pretty awesome so far. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt;. I have to say, I think my wife&amp;#39;s grandmother (grandmother-in-law?) takes the cake. When she can, I&amp;#39;ll have my wife come fill in more details with her account but until then, here&amp;#39;s your story. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The year is 1964 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Back then, the town was very segregated based on income. It all depended what side of the railroad tracks you lived on. If you lived on the east side, you were a rich, well off country club going family. The east side was the poorer side; farmers, construction workers, waitresses, you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grandma Patty&amp;#39;s husband has just died this year; they lived on the east side. He left behind her, a 26 year old mother, a widow. Not only just a mother - a mother of 8 children. &lt;strong&gt;EIGHT FUCKING KIDS&lt;/strong&gt;. 7 boys, and 1 girl. All of them 1 year apart. The oldest was 9 years old, the youngest was a newborn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now mind you - this was in the 60s. The heart of the cultural revolution. Except this was in a motherfucking Iowa. It hadn&amp;#39;t exactly caught up yet, and really never has there. Its the midwest - that&amp;#39;s the way the shit happens. Grandma Patty raised these 8 boys and 1 girl herself. Entirely. She never remarried, never dated, never had any more help than a church would give a single mother of 8 children. She worked 3 jobs until she was in her 50&amp;#39;s. She worked non-stop, and still had time to be a mother the whole time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you ask her about it, she plays it off like it &amp;quot;wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal&amp;quot;. HA HA. Not only did she actually raise 8 great children (My father-in-law included is an awesome guy), but they have all continued to raise great families as well. Me, the son in law? I was basically brought into this family now. I never had much family - just my mother, really, and that&amp;#39;s another story all together but she passed away 2 years ago. Grandma Patty has made a huge effort to make sure I feel like a part of the family, and I can never thank her enough for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to my first family reunion on their side of the family a fair bit ago. About 100 people; 8 pairs of aunts and uncles. Countless cousins. We all went to visit Grandma Patty for her 85th birthday. She raised an entire generation of amazing, caring and successful people. There is a licensed construction contractor; there is a chiropractor; a doctor; you get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is a die hard woman&amp;#39;s rights lady; but she still thinks women should have a traditional family role.

She was 17 and my grandma was only 19 at the time. They managed to get on a boat en route to Taiwan. My uncle was born on the ship. After they landed, they moved and settled down for a few years in Taichung where my father was born. In Taiwan they faced racism by the aborigines, since fresh off boats weren't treated very kindly, they had to keep moving. Finally they found a home in Tainan, a city in the Southern parts of Taiwan. There my grandmother became increasingly involved first with the local church then with the village board. Eventually she was elected to become mayor. With her in charge, she was able to secure funding and hire men to pave the roads of the shanty little village they lived in. All the while my grandfather was serving in the Taiwanese Air Force as a aircraft maintenance sergeant. It is said that he could tell what parts of the engine were broken just by listening to the hum. Whether this part is true, I have no idea. Meanwhile my two aunts were born while all this was happening and money was short on many occasions. My grandma's political standing had to be maintained and much of their salary was spent on her career. Whatever was left went to their children and many nights they slept hungry, but they slept soundly knowing the kids were full. My grandpa continuously sought ways to improve himself by learning from engineering books he would buy from whatever money he had saved up, which was scarce and the books didn't come easy. \n\nWhen an opportunity of a life time came in the form of being able to serve overseas in Texas, he jumped at the chance to take the preliminary tests. He studied night and day to learn English in an environment where no one spoke it at all. I don't think he learned to speak it very well, but I think for damned sure he learned to read it fairly well because he and a few other men were the only ones that were qualified enough to go out of the entire Tainan airbase. He landed in Texas in 1963 and he served there for two years. He was paid on an American salary so understandably it was several times what he is used to getting back in Taiwan. In Texas, he didn't have many friends. His English was poor, having had next to no verbal practice before arriving. After having worked a long day, he spent his nights constantly studying various grammar and English practice books to better himself. The other airmen often ridiculed him and took advantage of him. There are many stories of how they would take food from his lunch box or borrow tools and fail to return them, because they knew that his English wasn't good enough to report them. Of course these incidents occurred less as he learned more, but he endured them all so that he could send paychecks back home to his wife and children. The most important thing he learned in Texas, however, was how nice the lifestyle was in America. He came home to Taiwan determined to get his family there one way or another.\n\nIt was a few years before he could accomplish that, however. Many years passed and my dad, uncle, and aunts all grew up to be strong, independent adults. My grandpa was nearing retirement age at this point and I'm sure he was proud that his two sons were also serving in the Air Force. My dad was a Colonel working with logistics before he retired and my uncle was a surgeon. It was around this time that my grandpa met a young Cantonese man that was stationed in the Tainan airbase during the time of the Vietnam War. My grandpa took a liking to this man and he introduced him to the family. The young man, Bob, married one of my aunts and he took her back to California, where they settled down and had my cousins. Through this singular, seemingly random meeting, my aunt who became a naturalized U.S. citizen was able to sign her siblings and parents up for immigration. \n\nMy family has been here ever since, all thanks to Bob. But really, I think none of this would've been able to happen if my grandparents didn't rise up to the challenge time and time again. My grandpa is 92 years old now and he's had Alzheimer, dementia, stroke, prostate cancer, Parkinson's... you name it. He was admitted to the hospital and had to live there for over a year but this summer he's made some major comebacks and is now living back at home, in Tainan where he and his wife started it all. He somehow regained his ability to recognize family members when he wasn't able to months prior, and more importantly, he can swallow foods and liquids on his own now. I know he doesn't have many years left in him, but I'm proud of him for making such a major recovery. \n\nIn my opinion, I think their early pregnancy worked out pretty well.\n\n**TL;DR** My grandparents are some tough mofos.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1348438436.0, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "aierx48hq220e071afad3237b7972087275bb6c6ff326e4c72", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "children": ["c6c9t5n", "c6cailq", "c6camim"], "id": "c6c9t5n", "name": "t1_c6c9t5n"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "banned_by": null, "downs": 10, "author": "Sheep-On-Fire", "created_utc": 1348413236.0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning, wall of text incoming.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grandparents fled Communist China while my grandmother was pregnant.
